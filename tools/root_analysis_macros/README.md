## ROOT Analysis Macros
Collection of macros to analyze the data generated by the framework. Currently contains a single macro to convert the TTree of objects to a tree containing typical standard data users are interested in. This is useful for simple comparisons with other frameworks.

#### Comparison tree
Read all the required tree from the given file and bind their contents to the objects defined in the framework. Then creates an output tree and bind every branch to a simple arithmetic type. Continues to loop over all the events in the tree and converting the stored data of the various trees to the output tree. The final output tree contains branches for the cluster sizes, aspect ratios, accumulated charge per event, the track position from the Monte-Carlo truth and the reconstructed track using a very simple direct center of gravity calculation using the charges without any corrections.
