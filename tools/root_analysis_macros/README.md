## ROOT Analysis Macros
Collection of macros to analyze the data generated by the framework. Currently contains a single macro to convert the TTree of objects to a tree containing typical standard data users are interested in. This is useful for simple comparisons with other frameworks.

#### Comparison tree
Read all the required tree from the given file and bind their contents to the objects defined in the framework. Then creates an output tree and bind every branch to a simple arithmetic type. Continues to loop over all the events in the tree and converting the stored data of the various trees to the output tree. The final output tree contains branches for the cluster sizes, aspect ratios, accumulated charge per event, the track position from the Monte-Carlo truth and the reconstructed track using a very simple direct center of gravity calculation using the charges without any corrections.

To construct a comparison tree using this macro follow these steps:
1. Open root with the data file attached like `root -l /path/to/data.root`
2. Load the current library of objects with `.L path/to/libAllpixObjects.so`
3. Build the macro with `.L path/to/constructComparisonTree.C++`
4. Run the macro with `auto tree = constructComparisonTree(_file0, "name_of_dut")`
5. Open a new file with `auto file = new TFile("output.root", "RECREATE")
6. Write the tree with `tree->Write()`

### Remake project
Simple macro to show the possiblity to recreate source files for legacy objects stored in ROOT data files from older versions of the framework. Can be used when the corresponding dynamic library for that particular version is not accessible anymore. It is not possible to add the methods of the objects and it is therefore not easily possible to reconstruct the stored history (when available).

To recreate the project source files
1. Open root with the data file attached like `root -l /path/to/data.root`
2. Build the macro with `.L path/to/remakeProject.C++`
3. Recreate the source files using `remakeProject(_file0, "output_dir")`
