# PulseTransfer
**Maintainer**: Simon Spannagel (simon.spannagel@cern.ch)
**Status**: Functional  
**Input**: PropagatedCharge  
**Output**: PixelCharge  

### Description
Combines individual induced charge pulses generated by propagated charges to one total pulse per pixel. This prepares the pulse for processing in the front-end electronics

A pulse graph for every pixel seeing a signal is generated if `output_pulsegraphs` is enabled
It should be noted that generating per-pixel pulses will generate several pulse graphs per event and might result in a slow-down of the simulation process as well as a larger module root file.

### Parameters
* `output_pulsegraphs` : Determines if pulse graphs should be generated for every event. This creates several graphs per event, depending on how many pixels see a signal, and can slow down the simulation. It is not recommended to enable this option for runs with more than a couple of events. Disabled by default.
