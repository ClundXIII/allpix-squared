### Trajectories
# display trajectories later
/vis/scene/endOfEventAction accumulate
/vis/scene/endOfRunAction accumulate
/tracking/storeTrajectory 1
#/vis/scene/add/trajectories
# display smoother lines, not just straight lines between step points.
/vis/scene/add/trajectories smooth
# adds hits to the current scene, assuming that you have a hit class and that the hits have visualization information.
/vis/scene/add/hits
# OpenGL supports hidden line removal. By default, hidden line removal is disabled
# To turn on hidden line removal. This hides edges of geometry, but lets trajectories through.
/vis/viewer/set/hiddenEdge 1
# To hide trajectories and hits as well

# Specify zoom value:
#/vis/viewer/zoom 2.
# Specify style (surface or wireframe): note that this will not affect volumes that have style explicitly forced by “setForceWireframe” or “setForceSolid” commands in the c++ code
