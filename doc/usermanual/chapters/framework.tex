\section{The \apsq Framework}
\label{sec:framework}
The framework is split up in the following four main components that together form \apsq:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Core}: The core contains the internal logic to initiate the modules, provide the geometry, facilitate module communication and run the event sequence. The core keeps its dependencies to a minimum (it only relies on ROOT) and remains separated from the other components as far as possibble. It is the main component discussed in this section.
\item \textbf{Modules}: A set of methods that execute a part of the simulation chain. These are build as separate libraries, loaded dynamically by the core. The available modules and their parameters are discussed in more detail in Section \ref{sec:modules}.
\item \textbf{Objects}: Objects are the data passed around between modules. They are contained into a single library and are transferred using the message framework provided by the core. Modules can listen and bind to messages they wish to receive. Messages are identified by the object type they are carrying, but they can also be named to allow redirecting data to specific modules facilitating more sophisticated simulations. Messages are meant to be read-only and a copy of the data should be made if a module wishes to change the data. More information about the messaging system and the supported objects can be found in Section \ref{sec:objects_messages}.
\item \textbf{Tools}: \apsq provides a set of header-only 'tools' that provide access to common logic shared by various modules. An example is a Eigen Runge-Kutta solver and a set of template specializations for ROOT and Geant4 configuration. More information about these can be found in Section \ref{sec:additional_tools_resources}. This set of tools is different from the set of core utilities the framework provides by itself, which are part of the core and explained in \ref{sec:logging_utilities}
\end{enumerate}
Finally \apsq provides an executable which instantiates the core, passes the configuration and runs the simulation chain.

In this chapter, first an overview of the architectural setup of the core is given and how it interacts with the total \apsq framework. Afterwards, the different subcomponents are discussed and explained in more detail. Some C++ code will be provided in the text, but readers not interested may skip the technical details.

\subsection{Architecture of the Core}
The core is constructed as a light-weight framework that provides various subsystems to the modules. It also contains the part responsible for instantiating and running the modules from the supplied configuration file. The core is structured around five subsystems of which four are centered around managers and the fifth contain a set of simple general utilities. The systems provided are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Configuration}: Provides a general configuration object from which data can be retrieved or stored, together with a TOML-like~\cite{tomlgit} file parser to instantiate the configurations. Also provides a general \apsq configuration manager providing access to the main configuration file and its sections. It is used by the module manager system to find the required instantiations and access the global configuration. More information is given in Section \ref{sec:config_parameters}.
\item \textbf{Module}: Contain the base class of all the \apsq modules and the manager responsible for loading and running the modules (using the configuration system). This component is discussed in more detail in Section \ref{sec:module_manager}.
\item \textbf{Geometry}: Supplies helpers for the simulation geometry. The manager contains all registered detectors. A detector has a certain position and orientation linked to an instantiation of a particular detector model. The detector model contains all parameters describing the geometry of the detector. More details about the geometry and detector models is provided in Section \ref{sec:models_geometry}.
\item \textbf{Messenger}: The messenger is responsible for sending objects from one module to another. The messenger object is passed to every module and can be used to bind to messages to listen for. Messages with objects are also dispatched through the messenger to send data to the modules listening. Please refer to Section \ref{sec:objects_messages} for more details.
\item \textbf{Utilities}: The framework provides a set of simple utilities for logging, file and directory access, random number seeding and unit conversion. An explanation how to use of these utilities can be found in Section \ref{sec:logging_utilities}. A set of C++ exceptions is also provided in the utilities, which are inherited and extended by the other components. Proper use of exceptions, together with logging informational messages and reporting errors, make the framework easier to use and debug. A few notes about the use and structure of exceptions are given in Section \ref{sec:error_reporting_exceptions}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Configuration and Parameters}
\label{sec:config_parameters}
Modules and the framework are configured through configuration files. An explanation how to use the various configuration files together with several examples are provided in Section \ref{sec:configuration_files}. All configuration files follow the same format, but the way their input is interpreted differs per configuration file.

\subsubsection{File format}
\label{sec:config_file_format}
Throughout the framework a standard format is used for the configuration files, a simplified version of TOML~\cite{tomlgit}. The rules for this format are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item All whitespace at the beginning or end of a line should be stripped by the parser. Empty lines should be ignored.
\item Every non-empty line should start with either \texttt{\#}, \texttt{[} or an alphanumeric character. Every other character should lead to an immediate parse error.
\item If the line starts with \texttt{\#}, it is interpreted as comment and all other content on the same line is ignored
\item If the line starts with \texttt{[}, the line indicates a section header (also known as configuration header). The line should contain an alphanumeric string indicating the header name followed by \texttt{]} to end the header (a missing \texttt{]} should raise an exception). Multiple section header with the same name are allowed. All key-value pairs following this section header are part of this section until a new section header is started. After any number of ignored whitespace characters there may be a \texttt{\#} character. If that is the case, the rest of the line is handled as specified in point~3.
\item If the line starts with an alphanumeric character, the line should indicate a key-value pair. The beginning of the line should contain an string of alphabetic characters, numbers and underscores, but note that it may not start with an underscore). This string indicates the 'key'. After a optional number of ignored whitespace, the key should be followed by an \texttt{$=$}. Any text between the \texttt{$=$} and the first \texttt{\#} character not enclosed within a pair of \texttt{"} characters is known as the non-stripped 'value'. Any character from the \texttt{\#} is handled as specified in point 3. If the line does not contain any non-enclosed \texttt{\#} character the value ends at the end of the line instead. The 'value' of the key-value pair is the non-stripped 'value' with all whitespace in front and the end stripped.
\item The value can either be accessed as a single value or an array. If the value is accessed as an array, the string is split at every whitespace or \texttt{,} character not enclosed in a pair of \texttt{"} characters. All empty entities are not considered. All other entities are treated as single values in the array.
\item All single values are stored as a string containing at least one character. The conversion to the actual type is executed when accessing the value.
\item All key-value pairs defined before the first section header are part of a zero-length empty section header
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Accessing parameters}
\label{sec:accessing_parameters}
All values are accessed via the configuration object. In the following example the key is a string called \textbf{key}, the object is named \textbf{config} and the type \textbf{TYPE} is a valid C++ type that the value should represent. The values can be accessed via the following methods:
\begin{minted}[frame=single,framesep=3pt,breaklines=true,tabsize=2,linenos]{c++}
// returns true if the key exists and false otherwise
config.has("key") 
// returns the value in the given type, throws an exception if not existing
config.get<TYPE>("key") 
// returns the value in the given type or the provided default value if it does not exist
config.get<TYPE>("key", default_value) 
// returns an array of single values of the given type; throws if the key does not exist
config.getArray<TYPE>("key")
// returns an absolute (canonical if it should exist) path to a file
config.getPath("key", true /* check if path exists */)
// return an array of absolute paths
config.getPathArray("key", false /* check if paths exists */)
// returns the key as literal text including possible quotation marks
config.getText("key") 
// set the value of key to the default value if the key is not defined
config.setDefault("key", default_value) 
// set the value of the key to the defaults array if key is not defined
config.setDefaultArray<TYPE>("key", vector_of_default_values)
\end{minted}

The conversions to the type are using the \texttt{from\_string} and \texttt{to\_string} methods provided by the string utility library described in Section \ref{sec:string_utilities}. These conversions largely follows the standard C++ parsing, with one important exception. If (and only if) the value is retrieved as any C/C++ string type and the string is fully enclosed by a pair of \texttt{"} characters, they are stripped before returning the value (and strings can thus also be given without quotation marks).

\subsection{Modules and the Module Manager}
\label{sec:module_manager}
\apsq is a modular framework, the core idea is to separate functionality in various independent modules. The modules are defined in the subdirectory \textit{src/modules/} in the repository. The name of the directory is the unique name of the module. The suggested naming scheme is CamelCase, thus an example module would be \textit{GenericPropagation}. There are two different kind of modules which can be defined:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Unique}: Modules for which always a single instance runs irrespective of the number of detectors.
\item \textbf{Detector}: Modules that are specific to a single detector. They are replicated for all required detectors.
\end{itemize}
The type of module determines the kind of constructor used, the internal unique name and the supported configuration parameters. More details about the instantiation logic for the different kind of modules can be found in \ref{sec:module_instantiation}.

\subsubsection{Files of a Module}
\label{sec:module_files}
Every module directory should at the minimum contain the following documents (with \texttt{ModuleName} replaced by the name of the module):
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{CMakeLists.txt}: The build script to load the dependencies and define the source files
\item \textbf{README.md}: Short documentation of the module
\item \textbf{\texttt{ModuleName}.tex}: Full documentation of the module for this Users Manual
\item \textbf{\texttt{ModuleName}Module.hpp}: The header file of the module (note that another name can be used for this source file, but that is deprecated)
\item \textbf{\texttt{ModuleName}Module.cpp}: The implementation file of the module
\end{itemize}
The files are discussed in more detail below. Before the module can be used it should also be linked to the main CMakeLists.txt in \textit{src/modules/} by adding \\ ALLPIX\_BUILD\_MODULE(\texttt{ModuleName}) with the \texttt{ModuleName} being the directory of the module. 

More information about constructing new modules can be found in Section \ref{sec:building_new_module}.

\paragraph{CMakeLists.txt}
Contains the build description of the module with the following components:
\begin{enumerate}
\item On the first line either ALLPIX\_DETECTOR\_MODULE(MODULE\_NAME) or \\ ALLPIX\_UNIQUE\_MODULE(MODULE\_NAME) depending on the type of the module defined. The internal name of the module is saved to the \$\{MODULE\_NAME\} variable which should be used as argument to the other functions. Another name can be used as well, but below we exclusively use \$\{MODULE\_NAME\}
\item The next lines should contain the logic to load the dependencies of the module. Only ROOT is automatically included and linked to the module.
\item A line with ALLPIX\_MODULE\_SOURCES(\$\{MODULE\_NAME\} \texttt{sources}) where \texttt{sources} should be replaced by all the source files of this module
\item Possibly lines to include the directories and link the libraries for all the dependencies loaded in point~2.
\item A line containing ALLPIX\_MODULE\_INSTALL(\$\{MODULE\_NAME\}) to setup the required target for the module to be installed to.
\end{enumerate}

An example of a simple CMakeLists.txt of a module named \texttt{Test} which requires Geant4 is the following
\vspace{5pt}

\begin{minted}[frame=single,framesep=3pt,breaklines=true,tabsize=2,linenos]{cmake}
# Define module and save name to MODULE_NAME
# Replace by ALLPIX_DETECTOR_MODULE(MODULE_NAME) to define a detector module
ALLPIX_UNIQUE_MODULE(MODULE_NAME) 

# Load Geant4
FIND_PACKAGE(Geant4)
IF(NOT Geant4_FOUND)
    MESSAGE(FATAL_ERROR "Could not find Geant4, make sure to source the Geant4 environment\n$ source YOUR_GEANT4_DIR/bin/geant4.sh")
ENDIF()

# Add the sources for this module
ALLPIX_MODULE_SOURCES(${MODULE_NAME} 
    TestModule.cpp
)

# Add Geant4 to the include directories
TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${MODULE_NAME} SYSTEM PRIVATE ${Geant4_INCLUDE_DIRS})

# Link the Geant4 libraries to the library
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(${MODULE_NAME} ${Geant4_LIBRARIES})

# Provide standard install target
ALLPIX_MODULE_INSTALL(${MODULE_NAME})
\end{minted}

\paragraph{README.md}
\wip

\paragraph{\texttt{ModuleName}.tex}
\wip

\paragraph{\texttt{ModuleName}Module.hpp and \texttt{ModuleName}Module.cpp}
All modules should have both a header file and a source file. In the header file the module is defined together with all its method. Brief Doxygen documentation should be added to explain what every method does. The source file should provide the implementation of every method and also its more detailed Doxygen documentation. Not a single method should be defined in the header to keep the interface clean.

\subsubsection{Module structure}
\label{sec:module_structure}
All modules should inherit from the Module base class which can be found in \textit{src/core/module/Module.hpp}. The module base class provides two base constructors, a few convenient methods and several methods to override. Every module should provide a constructor taking a fixed set of arguments defined by the framework. This particular constructor is always called during construction by the module instantiation logic. The arguments for the constructor differs for unique and detector modules. For unique modules the constructor for a TestModule should be:
\begin{minted}[frame=single,framesep=3pt,breaklines=true,tabsize=2]{c++}
TestModule(Configuration config, Messenger* messenger, GeometryManager* geo_manager): Module(config) {}
\end{minted}
It is clear that the configuration object should be forwarded to the base module.

For unique modules the first two arguments are the same, but the last argument is a shared\_ptr to the linked detector instead. It should always forward this provided detector to the base class, besides the configuration. Thus a constructor of a detector module should be:
\begin{minted}[frame=single,framesep=3pt,breaklines=true,tabsize=2]{c++}
TestModule(Configuration config, Messenger* messenger, std::shared_ptr<Detector> detector): Module(config, detector) {}
\end{minted}

All modules receive the Configuration object holding the config parameters for that specific object, which can be accessed as explained in Section \ref{sec:accessing_parameters}. Furthermore, a pointer to the Messenger is passed which can be used to both bind variables to receive and dispatch messages as explained in \ref{sec:objects_messages}. Finally either a pointer to the GeometryManager is passed, which can be used to fetch all detectors, or a instance of the specifically linked detector. The constructor should normally be used to bind the required messages and set configuration defaults. In case of failure an exception can be thrown from the constructor. 

In addition to the constructor every module can override the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{init()}: Called after loading and constructing all modules and before starting the event loop. This method can for example be used to initialize histograms.
\item \texttt{run(unsigned int event\_number)}: Called for every event in the simulation run with the event number (starting from one). An exception should be thrown for every serious error, otherwise an warning should be logged.
\item \texttt{finalize()}: Called after processing all events in the run and before destructing the module. Typically used to save the output data (like histograms). Any exceptions should be thrown from here instead of the destructor.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Module instantiation}
\label{sec:module_instantiation}
The modules are dynamically loaded and instantiated by the Module Manager. Modules are constructed, initialized, executed and finalized in the linear order they are defined in the configuration file. Thus the configuration file should follow the order of the real process. For every non-special section in the main configuration file (see \ref{sec:config_parameters} for more details) a corresponding library is searched which contains the module. A module has the name \textbf{libAllPixModule\texttt{ModuleName}} reflecting the \texttt{ModuleName} of a defined module. The module search order is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The modules already loaded before from an earlier section header
\item All directories in the global configuration parameter \textit{library\_directories} in the provided order if this parameter exists
\item The internal RPATH of the executable, that should automatically point to the libraries that are build and installed together with the executable.
\item The other standard locations to search for libraries depending on the operating system, see \url{http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html} for details about the procedure Linux follows.
\end{enumerate}

If the module definition is successful it is checked if the module is an unique or a detector module. The instantiation logic determines an unique name and priority, where a lower number indicates a higher priority, for every instantiation. The name and priority for the instantation are determined differently for the two types of modules:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Unique}: Combination of the name of the module and the \textbf{input} and \textbf{output} parameter (both defaulting to an empty string). The priority is always zero.
\item \textbf{Detector}: Combination of the name of the module, the \textbf{input} and \textbf{output} parameter (both defaulting to an empty string) and the name of detector this module runs on. If the name of the detector is specified directly by the \textbf{name} parameter the priority is zero. If the detector is only matched by the \textbf{type} parameter the priority is one. If the \textbf{name} and \textbf{type} are both not specified and the module is instantiated for all detectors there priority is two.
\end{itemize}
The instantiation logic only allows a single instance for every unique name. If there are multiple instantiations with the same unique name the instantiation with the highest priority is kept (thus the one with the lowest number). Otherwise if there are multiple instantiations with the same name and the same priority an exception is raised.

\subsection{Geometry and Detectors}
\label{sec:models_geometry}
Simulations are frequently run on a set of different detectors (such as as a beam telescope and a device under test). All these individual detectors together is what \apsq defines as the geometry. Every detector has a set of properties attached to it:
\begin{itemize}
\item A unique \textbf{name} to refer to the detector in the configuration.
\item The \textbf{position} in the world frame. This is the position of the geometric center of the sensitive device (sensor) given in world coordinates as X, Y and Z (note that any additional components like the chip or the PCB are ignored when determining the geometric center).
\item The \textbf{orientation} given as Euler angles using the extrinsic Z-X-Z convention relative to the world frame (also known as the 1-3-1 or the "x-convention" and the most widely used definition of Euler angles~\cite{eulerangles}). 
\item A \textbf{type} of a detector model. The model defines the geometry and parameters of the detector. Multiple detectors can share the same model (and this is in fact very common). Several ready-to-use models are shipped with the framework.
\item An optional \textbf{electric field} in the sensitive device. An electric field can be added to a detector by a special module as shown in section \ref{sec:module_electric_field}.
\end{itemize}
The detector configuration is provided in the special detector configuration which is explained in Section \ref{sec:detector_config}.

The detectors can be accessed by name through the GeometryManager. If the module is a detector-specific module its related Detector can be accessed through the \texttt{getDetector()} method (returns a null pointer for unique modules) as follows:
\begin{minted}[frame=single,framesep=3pt,breaklines=true,tabsize=2]{c++}
void run(unsigned int event_id) {
    // returns the linked detector
    std::shared_ptr<Detector> detector = this->getDetector();
}
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Coordinate systems}
All detectors have a fixed position in the world frame which has an arbitrary origin. Every detector also has a local coordinate system attached to it. The origin of this local coordinate system does not necessarily correspond with the geometric center of the sensitive device, which is the center of orientation of the detector in the global frame. The origin of the local coordinate system is instead based on the pixel grid in the sensor. This allows for simpler calculations that are also easier to read. 

While the origin of the local coordinate system depends on the type of the model, there are fixed rules for the orientation of the coordinate system. The positive z-axis should point from the side of the sensor where collection takes place upwards (normal to the collection plane) to the other side of the sensitive device. The x-axis should point in one of the arbitrary two directions in the plane of the pixel grid. The y-axis should then be normal to both the x and the z-axis in such a way that a right-handed coordinate system is constructed. The 2D pixel grid is therefore in the XY-plane.

\subsubsection{Detector models}
\label{sec:detector_models}
Different types of detector models are already available and shipped with the framework. Every models extends from the DetectorModel base class which defines the minimum parameter of a detector model in the framework:
\begin{itemize}
\item The coordinate of the rotation center in the local frame. This is the location of the local point which is defined as position in the global frame.
\item The position of the bottom-left (minimum) of the sensor (thus the sensitive device) in the local frame. This determines the excess of the sensor and the size of the guard rings around the pixel grid. 
\item The total size of the sensor (thus the top-right corner offset from the bottom-left minimum position).
\item The number of pixels in the sensor. Every pixel is an independent block replicated over the XY plane of the sensor. The number of pixel defaults to one if it is not overridden, which means the default sensor has no replicated blocks.
\item The size of an individual pixel. The multiplication of the pixel size and the number of pixels should not exceed the sensor.
\end{itemize}

This standard detector model can be extended to provide a more detailed geometry as required by certain modules. Currently the only included advanced detector model is the PixelDetectorModel \todo{should we change this name?}, which apart from the sensor also includes guards rings, bump bonds, a readout ASIC chip, a PCB and a cover layer. 

To fetch a detector model as PixelDetectorModel, the base class should be downcasted as follows (the downcast return a null pointer if it is not a PixelDetectorModel).
\begin{minted}[frame=single,framesep=3pt,breaklines=true,tabsize=2]{c++}
// detector is a pointer to a Detector object
std::shared_ptr<PixelDetectorModel> model = std::dynamic_pointer_cast<PixelDetectorModel>(detector->getModel());
if(model != nullptr) {
    // the model of this Detector is a PixelDetectorModel
}
\end{minted}
For more details about the different types of supported models and how to add your own new model, Section \ref{sec:adding_detector_model} should be consulted.

Many detector models are shipped with the framework in the configuration format introduced in Section \ref{sec:config_file_format}. Other models can however be used in addition. To support different detector models and configuration formats the framework supports different types of model readers. These model readers search the directories in the following order:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If defined, the paths in the \textit{models\_path} parameter provided to the reader module (overridden by the global configuration \textit{models\_path}) in the given order. Files are added directly. If the path is a directory, all files in the directory are added (not recursing into subdirectories).
\item The location where the models are installed to (see the MODEL\_DIRECTORY variable in Section \ref{sec:cmake_config}). 
\item The standard data paths on the system as given by the environmental variable \$XDG\_DATA\_DIRS with the \project-directory appended. The \$XDG\_DATA\_DIRS variable defaults to \textit{/usr/local/share/} (thus effectively \textit{/usr/local/share/\project}) followed by \textit{/usr/share/} (effectively \textit{/usr/share/\project}).
\end{enumerate}
 The framework provides a DefaultModelReader module to read all the default models in the framework. Almost every simulation should include this module.

\todo{This should include more details about different model readers}

\subsection{Passing Objects using Messages}
\label{sec:objects_messages}
Communication between modules happens almost solely through messages (only some information is shared through the internally used dependencies like Geant4). Most messages are templated instantiations of the Message class carrying a vector of objects. A typedef is typically added by the object to provide an alternative name for the message directly linking to the object it is carrying. The message system has a dispatching part and a receiver part. The dispatching module can specify an optional name for the message and the receiver can also optionally specify a name to listen to. The following rules are used to dispatch the message to their receivers:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the message type (thus usually the object type) of the receiving module does not match the type of the sending module, the message will \underline{never} be dispatched to this receiving module.
\item If the module is a detector module and the dispatched message has a detector attached, the message will \underline{never} be dispatched to this module if the detector does \underline{not} match the detector linked to the detector module.
\item If the name of the dispatched message is unspecified (or empty) the message will be dispatched to all modules (not excluded by earlier rules).
\item If the dispatched message has a specific name the message will only be dispatched to modules listening to exactly that name \underline{and} also to general listening modules that did not specify the name to receive (or set it to empty).
\end{enumerate}

An example how to dispatch a message containing an array of \textbf{Object} types, bound to a particular detector named \texttt{detector}, in the \texttt{run()} function of a certain module is provided here:
\begin{minted}[frame=single,framesep=3pt,breaklines=true,tabsize=2]{c++}
void run(unsigned int event_id) {
    std::vector<Object> data;
    // .. fill the data vector with objects ...
    
    // the last argument should be ommitted if not bound to detector
    std::shared_ptr<Message<Object>> message = std::make_shared<Message<Object>>(data, "detector");
    
    // the messenger object is a pointer to the Messenger class
    messenger->dispatchMessage(message, "" /* unnamed message */);
}
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Methods to process messages}
The message system has multiple methods to process received messages. The first of these two are the most common methods and the third one should only rarely be used. The options are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Bind a \textbf{single message} to a variable. This should usually be the preferred method as most modules only expect one message to arrive per event (as a module should typically send only one message containing the list of all the objects it should send). An example of how to bind a message containing an array of \textbf{Object} types in the constructor of a unique TestModule would be:
\begin{minted}[frame=single,framesep=3pt,breaklines=true,tabsize=2]{c++}
TestModule(Configuration, Messenger* messenger, GeometryManager*) {
    messenger->bindSingle(this, 
                          /* pointer to the message pointer */
                          &TestModule::message,
                          /* listen to every name */
                          "",
                          /* no message flags */
                          MsgFlags::NONE);
}
std::shared_ptr<Message<Object>> message;
\end{minted}
\item Bind a \textbf{set of messages} to an array variable. This method should be used it the module can (and expects to) receive the same message multiple times (possibly because it wants to receive the same type of message for all detectors). An example to bind multiple messages containing an array of \textbf{Object} types in the constructor of a unique TestModule would be:
\begin{minted}[frame=single,framesep=3pt,breaklines=true,tabsize=2]{c++}
TestModule(Configuration, Messenger* messenger, GeometryManager*) {
    messenger->bindMulti(this,
                          /* pointer to the message pointer */
                          &TestModule::messages,
                          /* listen to every name */
                          "",
                          /* no message flags */
                          MsgFlags::NONE);
}
std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Message<Object>>> messages;
\end{minted}
\item Listen to a particular message type and execute a \textbf{listening function} as soon as an object is received. Should be used for more advanced strategies for fetching messages. The listening module should NEVER do any heavy work in the listening function as this is supposed to take place in the run() method instead. An example of using this to listen to a message containing an array of \textbf{Object} types in a unique TestModule would be:
\begin{minted}[frame=single,framesep=3pt,breaklines=true,tabsize=2]{c++}
TestModule(Configuration, Messenger* messenger, GeometryManager*) {
    messenger->registerListener(this,
                                /* pointer to the message pointer */
                                &TestModule::listener,
                                /* listen to every name */
                                "",
                                /* no message flags */
                                MsgFlags::NONE);
}
void listener(std::shared_ptr<Message<Object>> message) {
    // do something with received message ...
}
\end{minted}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Messenger flags}
Various flags can be added to the bind function and listening functions. The flags enable a particular behaviour of the framework (if the particular type of method supports the flag).
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{REQUIRED}: Specify that this message is required to be received. If the particular type of message is not received before it is time to execute the run function, the run is automatically skipped by the framework. This can be used to ignore actions that would be useless without received messages, like propagating charges without any deposits.
\item \textbf{NO\_RESET}: Messages are by default automatically resetted after the run function executes to prevent older messages from previous runs to appear again. This behaviour can be disabled by setting this flag (this does not have any effect for listening functions). Setting this flag for single bound messages (without ALLOW\_OVERWRITE) would causes an exception to be raised if the message is overwritten in a later event.
\item \textbf{ALLOW\_OVERWRITE}: By default an exception is automatically raised if a single bound message is overwritten (thus set multiple times instead of once). This flag prevents this behaviour, it is only useful for single bound variables. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Object types}
All supported objects that can be transferred between modules are shipped with the framework in the Objects library. This list of objects currently consists of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{DepositedCharge}: Set of charges at a specific position in the sensor of a detector.
\item \textbf{PropagatedCharge}: Charge at a specific position after propagation \todo{THIS OBJECT WILL BE REMOVED?}.
\item \textbf{PixelCharge}: Set of charges at a particular pixel in the pixel grid.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logging and other Utilities}
\label{sec:logging_utilities}
The \apsq framework provides a set of utilities that can be split up in two type of utilies:
\begin{itemize}
\item A few utilities to extend the functionality provided by the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). These are provided either to simplify access to the STL (like the random seed generator utility) or to provide functionality the C++14 standard lacks (like filesystem support). The referred utilities are used internally in the framework and only shortly discussed. The utilities falling in this category are the random seed generator (see Section \ref{sec:random_generator}), the filesystem functions (see Section \ref{sec:filesystem}) and the string utilies (see Section \ref{sec:string_utilities}).
\item Two utilities to improve the usability of the framework. One of these is a flexible and easy-to-use logging system, introduced below in Section \ref{sec:logger}. The other is an easy-to-use framework for units that supports converting arbitrary combinations of units to an independent number which can  be used transparently through the framework. It will be discussed in more detail in Section \ref{sec:unit_system}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Logger}
\label{sec:logger}
The logger is build to handle input/output in the same way as std::cin and std::cout do. This system is both very flexible and easy to read. It is globally configured, thus there exists only one logger and there no ocal loggers in for example a module. To send a message to the logger at a level of \textbf{LEVEL}, the following can be used:
\begin{minted}[frame=single,framesep=3pt,breaklines=true,tabsize=2,linenos]{c++}
LOG(LEVEL) << "this is an example message with data " << 1 << 2.0;
\end{minted}
Note that a newline is added at the end of every log message. Multi-line log messages can also be used: the logger will automatically align the new lines under the message itself and will leave the header space empty on the new lines.

\todo{MOVED TO GETTING STARTED}

\subsubsection{Unit system}
\label{sec:unit_system}
In physics (and therefore HEP as well) units are used a lot. Having a separate C++ type for all different kind of units would be too cumbersome for a lot of operations. Therefore the units are stored in standard C++ types in a pre-defined unit and all code in the framework uses the same unit. In various configuration files it is however very useful to give quantities in another unit. For logging it is also useful to display data in another unit.

The unit system allows adding, getting and converting units. It is a global system, thus all units should be equal through the whole framework. Examples of using the unit system are the given below:
\begin{minted}[frame=single,framesep=3pt,breaklines=true,tabsize=2,linenos]{c++}
// define the standard length unit and an auxiliary unit
Units::add("mm", 1); 
Units::add("m", 1e3); 
// define the standard time unit
Units::add("ns", 1); 
// get the units given in m/ns in the defined framework unit mm/ns
Units::get(1, "m/ns"); 
// get the framework unit of mm/ns in m/ns for logging etc
Units::convert(1, "m/ns");
\end{minted}

More details about how the unit system is used within AllPix can be found in Section \ref{sec:config_values}.

\subsubsection{Internal utilities}
\paragraph{Filesystem}
\label{sec:filesystem}
Provide functions to convert relative to absolute canonical paths, to go through all files in a directory and to create new directories. These functions should be replaced by the C++17 filesystem API\cite{cppfilesystem} as soon as the framework minimum standard is updated to C++17.

\paragraph{String utilies}
\label{sec:string_utilities}
The STL only provides string conversions for standard types using stringstream and std::to\_string. It does not allow to parse strings encapsulated in pairs of \texttt{"} characters and neither does it allow to integrate different units. Furthermore it does not provide wide flexibility to add custom conversions for other external types in both ways. The \apsq to\_string and from\_string do allow for these flexible conversions and it it extensively used in the configuration system. Conversions of numeric types with a unit attached are automatically resolved using the unit system discussed in Section \ref{sec:unit_system}. The \apsq tools system contain extensions to allow automatic conversions for ROOT and Geant4 types. The string utilities also include trim and split strings functions as they are not yet part of the STL.

\paragraph{Random seed generator}
\label{sec:random_generator}
Generating random number with a high-level of entropy is very important for running all Monte-Carlo processes in high-energy physics. Good random generators are already included in both the standard library and various external libraries. Seeding those random generators with enough entropy or seeding them with a predefined seed instead (to allow rerunning a certain simulation) should however be a framework task. This small utility library provides the required method to return a correct seed to all random generators.

\subsection{Error Reporting and Exceptions}
\label{sec:error_reporting_exceptions}
Feedback to users during the simulation is very important. The logger should be used extensively to report informational messages. Besides that reporting errors is very important. \apsq follows the principle to throw exceptions in all cases where something is wrong, it should never try to circumvent problems. Also error codes are not supposed to be used, only exceptions should be used to report fatal errors. Exceptions are also thrown for errors in the user configuration. Following this rule may lead to more frequent exceptions, but in a simulation it is typically not a problem to stop with a severe error. The asset of this method is that configuration and code is more likely to do what they are supposed to do.

The base exceptions in AllPix are defined in the utility section. The most important exception base classes are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{ConfigurationError}: All errors related to incorrect user configuration. Could be for example a non-existing configuration file, a missing key or an invalid parameter value.
\item \textbf{RuntimeError}: All other errrors coming up at run-time. Could be related to incorrect configuration if messages are not correctly passed or non-existing detectors are specified. Could also be raised if errors come up while loading the library or running the modules.
\item \textbf{LogicError}: Problems related to incorrectly coded modules, for example if a detector module fails to pass the detector to the constructor. These methods should never be raised for a correctly coded module and should therefore not be triggerable by users. Reporting these type of errors can help developers during their development of new modules.
\end{itemize}
