\todo{I think all the AP2 tools belong here as well}

\subsection{Framework Tools}
\subsubsection{ROOT and Geant4 utilities}
\label{sec:root_and_geant4_utilities}
The framework provides a set of methods to ease the integration of ROOT and Geant4 in the framework. An important part is the extension of the custom conversion \texttt{to\_string} and \texttt{from\_string} methods from the internal string utilities (see Section \ref{sec:string_utilities}) to support internal ROOT and Geant4 classes. This allows for directly reading configuration parameters to those types, making the code in the modules both shorter and cleaner. Besides this, some other conversions functions are provided together with other useful utilities (for example to display a ROOT vector with units attached).

\subsubsection{Runge-Kutta integrator}
A fast Eigen-powered~\cite{eigen3} Runge-Kutta integrator is provided as a tool to solve differential equations. The Runge-Kutta integrator is build genericly and supports multiple methods using different tableaus. It allows to integrate every system of equations in several steps with customizable timestep. This time step can also be updated during the integration depending on the error of the Runge-Kutta method (when a tableau with errors is used).
