## TCAD DF-ISE mesh converter
This code takes the .grd and .dat files of the DF-ISE format from TCAD simulations as input. The .grd file contains the vertex coordinates (3D or 2D) of each mesh node and the .dat file contains the value of each electric field vector component for each mesh node, grouped by model regions (such as silicon bulk or metal contacts). The regions are defined in the .grd file by grouping vertices into edges, faces and, consecutively, volumes or elements.

A new regular mesh is created by scanning the model volume in regular X Y and Z steps (not necessarily coinciding with original mesh nodes) and using a barycentric interpolation method to calculate the respective electric field vector on the new point. The interpolation uses the four closest, no-coplanar, neighbor vertex nodes such, that the respective tetrahedron encloses the query point. For the neighbors search, the software uses the Octree implementation [@octree] (see below).

The output .init file (with the same name as the .grd and .dat files) can be imported into Allpix Squared. The INIT file has a header followed by a list of columns organized as
```bash
node.x	node.y	node.z	observable.x	observable.y	observable.z
```

#### Features
- TCAD DF-ISE file format reader.
- Fast radius neighbor search for three-dimensional point clouds.
- Barycentric interpolation between non-regular mesh points.
- Several cuts available on the interpolation algorithm variables.
- Interpolated data visualization tool.

#### Usage
To run the program, the following should be executed from the installation folder:
```bash
bin/tcad_dfise_converter/dfise_converter -f <file_name_prefix> [<options>] [<arguments>]
```
The list with options can be accessed using the -h option.
Default values are assumed for the options not used. Possible options are:
```
-R <region> 		= "bulk"
-O <observable>		= "ElectricField"
-d <dimensions>		= 3
-r <search radius>	= 1 um
-r <radius step>	= 0.5 um
-m <max radius>		= 10 um
-c <volume cut>		= 10e-9 um^3
-x,y,z <mesh binning>	= 100 (option should be set using -x, -y and -z)
```

Observables currently implemented for interpolation are: *ElectrostaticPotential*, *ElectricField*, *DopingConcentration*, *DonorConcentration* and *AcceptorConcentration*.
The output INIT file will be saved with the same *file_name_prefix* as the .grd and .dat files, +*_observable_interpolated.init*.

The *mesh_plotter* tool can be used from the installation folder as follows:
```bash
bin/tcad_dfise_converter/mesh_plotter -f <file_name> [<options>] [<arguments>]
```
The list with options and defaults is displayed with the -h option. A default value of 100 is used for the binning, but this can be changed.
In a 3D mesh, the plane to be plotted must be identified by using the option -p with argument *xy*, *yz* or *zx*, defaulting to *yz*.
The data to be plotted can be selected with the -d option, the arguments are *ex*, *ey*, *ez* for the vector components or the default value *n* for the norm of the electric field.
