\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mathieu Benoit}, \textbf{John Idarraga}, \textbf{Samir Arfaoui} and all other contributors to the first version of AllPix, for their earlier work that inspired \apsq.
\item \textbf{Neal Gauvin} for interesting discussion, his experiments with TGeo and his help implementing a visualization module.
\item \textbf{Paul Sch\"utze} for contributing his earlier work on simulating charge propagation and providing help on simulations with electric fields.
\item \textbf{Marko Petric} for his help setting up several software tools like continous integration and automatic static-code analysis.
\item \textbf{Salman Maqbool} for comments on the documentation and his help with porting the detector models from the original AllPix.
\item \textbf{Moritz Kiehn} for his contributions to the code and helpful discussions on different matters concerning the simulation process.
\item \textbf{Mateus Vicente} for his help in implementing a tool to interpolate electric fields from a TCAD mesh format to the grid used in \apsq.
